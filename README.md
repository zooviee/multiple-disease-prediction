# üß† Multiple Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that uses **machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of three major diseases based on user input:

* ü©∫ **Diabetes**
* ‚ù§Ô∏è **Heart Disease**
* üó£Ô∏è **Parkinson's Disease**

It provides an accessible interface for early health screening and educational awareness, built using Python, Streamlit, and pre-trained models.


## üìå Project Features

* üîç **Three Disease Prediction Modules**:

  * **Diabetes**: Based on health parameters like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
  * **Heart Disease**: Uses features such as cholesterol, resting BP, ECG, and chest pain type.
  * **Parkinson‚Äôs**: Leverages voice measurements and motor control indicators.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **Machine Learning Models**:

  * Trained with **scikit-learn** classifiers (Logistic Regression and SVM).
  * Models were serialized using **`joblib`** for deployment.

* üñ•Ô∏è **Streamlit Interface**:

  * Intuitive sidebar navigation
  * Real-time predictions with dynamic input sliders and fields
  * Deployed locally via `streamlit run`
